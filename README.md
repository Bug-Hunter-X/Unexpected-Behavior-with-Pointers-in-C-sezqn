This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming involving pointers and memory management. The `bug.c` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to incorrect pointer usage. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version of the code. This example highlights the importance of understanding pointer arithmetic and memory management in C to avoid subtle errors and unexpected behavior.
